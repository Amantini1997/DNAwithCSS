# DNAwithCSS

This is a graphical representation of DNA double helix realised using pure HTML and CSS.

The bases order is generated randomly and changes every time the page is loaded.
To prevent sudden CPU hogging, the page operates a progressive loading of the double helix.

To access the graphic model just click this [link](https://amantini1997.github.io/DNAwithCSS/).

**Enjoy :)**
